## Hey, What's Kenium All About?

Hey there! Kenium is my take on a totally free, open-source Discord music bot that's built for fun and simplicity in 2025. No sneaky paywalls, no annoying vote prompts—just you, your friends, and some great tunes. Whether you're queuing up your favorite tracks, pulling up lyrics, or tweaking the sound with filters, Kenium keeps things smooth and easy. It's non-profit and all about the vibes.

## What Makes Kenium Special? 🚀

I wanted to build something that feels effortless to use, so here's a quick rundown of why it might be your new go-to bot:

| Feature                       | Why You'll Love It                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Totally Free Sources**      | Pull music from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Vimeo, or even your own files. No ads, no upsells—just pure playback. |
| **Simple, Intuitive Commands**| Stuff like `/play [song]`, `/shuffle`, or `/clear` queue. Plus, smart autocomplete to make your life easier. |
| **Extra Goodies Beyond Basics**| Grab lyrics on the fly, export playlists, or slap on audio filters like bass boost or slow-mo for that perfect mood. |
| **High-Performance Audio**    | Built with Aqualink  our own Lavalink/Nodelink wrapper, focused on pure performance, speed, and stability. |
| **Built to Be Reliable**      | Crafted with TypeScript and Seyfert for a lightweight, crash-resistant setup that's easy on your resources. |
