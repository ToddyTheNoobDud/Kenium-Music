# Thorium
An Full rewrite of my bot

Before 2.0.0:
Distube system
Kinda slow
Buggy

Now (2.0.0)

Lavalink system
Faster version
Should be more optimized and efficient
More stable

# Installation
download this repository as a zip and unpack
(or git clone https://github.com/ToddyTheNoobDud/Toddys-Distube-Bot)

Recommended using PNPM 

do npm install or pnpm install

now go on config.mjs and put the bot token and id, done
then go on bot.mjs and put your lavalink system
